For the tobacco industry, think tanks play an important role in indirect lobbying of government. Denied direct lobbying access to governments due to Article 5.3 of the UN Convention on Tobacco Control, an obvious route to influence policy and debate is by funding think tanks. This is called [[Third Party Techniques]]. Below is a list of think tanks from around the world which have supported tobacco industry positions and, in many cases, accepted funding without publicising the source. None of these organisations have broken any laws. For many of them we provide individual pages giving even more background information which can be found by clicking on the title of the organisation. 

==Lack of Transparency==
In the UK and the US most right-wing and libertarian think tanks do not disclose who funds them, so the link to the tobacco industry, if it exists, is often hidden. The millions of tobacco industry documents in the Legacy Tobacco Documents Library do show that certain leading right wing UK think tanks such as the [[Adam Smith Institute]] and the [[Institute of Economic Affairs]] used to receive tobacco funding. While the IEA does not disclose its funding sources and has repeatedly received a “one star” (the lowest) rating by transparency watchdog Transparency International <ref>Transparify, [https://web.archive.org/web/20190103153936/https:/www.transparify.org/blog/2018/11/16/pressure-grows-on-uk-think-tanks-that-fail-to-disclose-their-funders Pressure grows on UK think tanks that fail to disclose their funders], 16 November 2018, accessed July 2019</ref> it is known to have received funding from British American Tobacco (BAT) since 1963, and to date (January 2019) BAT describes itself as an IEA member in the EU Transparency Register.<ref> EU Transparency Register, [https://web.archive.org/save/http:/ec.europa.eu/transparencyregister/public/consultation/displaylobbyist.do?id=2427500988-58 British American Tobacco], last modified 23 May 2018, accessed January 2019</ref> As can be seen in the list below, such a lack of transparency is not limited to the UK.

==Benefits to the industry==
The benefit for tobacco companies is that these think tanks provide an echo-chamber for the industry, especially if they dress up the smoking and health debate in terms of freedom, the "nanny state" and excessive regulation. [[Michael Prideaux]], BAT’s former communications director concedes that “I think the libertarian argument resonates among people who wouldn’t normally take notice of what the tobacco industry say". <ref>Christopher Thompson,  [https://www.ft.com/content/bf180b30-74e5-11e1-a98b-00144feab49a Big Tobacco campaigns on freedom], ‘The Financial Times’, 6 April 2012, accessed July 2019</ref>
